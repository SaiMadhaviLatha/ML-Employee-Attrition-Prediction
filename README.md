Employee Attrition Prediction

This machine learning project focuses on predicting employee attrition using a real-world HR dataset. The goal is to help organizations identify employees likely to leave, enabling proactive retention strategies.

📌 Problem Statement  
Employee attrition leads to loss of valuable talent and increased costs. Using employee demographics, job data, and work patterns, this project builds a model to classify whether an employee will attrite.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
Python  
Pandas, NumPy  
Matplotlib, Seaborn  
Scikit-learn  
Jupyter Notebook  

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
Key insights:  
📉 Younger, lower-income, and less-experienced employees leave more often.  
⏰ Employees working overtime have higher attrition rates.  
📍 Distance from home shows some impact on attrition.  
🔗 Monthly income positively correlates with age and years at company.  
🧠 Model Summary  
Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier  
Accuracy: 84%  
Attrition Recall: 0.49 (model identifies 49% of attriters)  
Attrition Precision: 0.42 (room for improvement)
